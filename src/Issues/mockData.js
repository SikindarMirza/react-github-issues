Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n-->\r\nFixes #24279. JavaScript could not handle the large integer when there were numerous conditional statements before and after the hook. This was causing rounding errors which resulted in a conditional being evaluated incorrectly. I switched the functions to use BigInts instead and updated the eslintrc.js. If using BigInts is not acceptable, I'll be happy to try and find a different solution. \r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\nThe user who created the issue linked to a repository that showed the bug. I copied that exact code and pasted into the tests file. This test now passes.\r\nLink to repository: https://github.com/SanderRonde/eslint-hook-bug\r\n\r\nNow when I open that file in my local instance, there is no error message for the hook.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63068182/162086280-bae69c58-2285-4813-a10a-9c0d03a8a770.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I run all tests in ESLintRulesOfHooks-test.js, everything passes.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63068182/162086653-d428aec6-b953-4d7b-9020-7647259ff629.png)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when I ran yarn test --prod, I got several errors that were unrelated to ESLintRulesOfHooks. I am not sure if this is normal. ",

After the first toggle, the class component's componentWillUnmount is called twice. \r\n\r\nSubsequent toggle calls correctly lead to a single componentWillUnmount invocation.\r\n\r\nThis does only seem to affect the class component when its rendered first. If the condition is changed to initially show the other function component the class component unmounts just fine\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe class component's componentWillUnmount is only called once",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen using an exact number of conditionals before and after a react hook, the `React Hook \"hook_name\" is called conditionally. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render` rule is wrongly flagged as being violated. This is a really weird bug and it's kind of hard to explain. Just take a look at the code and watch as ESLint flags the hook as somehow being conditional. While this may seem like a huge edge case, this actually triggered in our code base and caused all hooks in the component to be flagged as conditional.\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.0.0 (doesn't seem to matter)\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Check out [this project](https://github.com/SanderRonde/eslint-hook-bug), run `yarn` and run `yarn eslint app/foo.tsx`.\r\n2. Watch as the hook is incorrectly flagged as conditional.\r\n3. Removing **or adding** one of the conditionals in the return statement makes the bug go away. The same goes for removing one of the conditionals above the hook.\r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://github.com/SanderRonde/eslint-hook-bug\r\nUnfortunately I couldn't get it to work online (because of a lack of terminals)\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nHook is incorrectly flagged as conditional\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5385012/161759839-c3ba7be0-d708-4eb3-975a-bcd08317bd45.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nHook should not be conditional\r\n",

            "body": "# How does DevTools work and what is the \"protocol version\"?\r\n\r\nThe React DevTools extension consists of multiple pieces:\r\n* The **frontend** portion is the extension you see (the Components tree, the Profiler, etc.).\r\n* The **backend** portion is invisible. It runs in the same context as React itself.\r\n\r\nThe frontend displays the current React tree, but it has no way to observe the tree directly because it runs in different memory space. It relies on the backend to describe the tree by sending \"messages\" through an API like [`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).\r\n\r\nThe most optimized way for the backend to share the state of the React tree is to send a small packet of [\"op codes\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/OVERVIEW.md#serializing-the-tree) whenever the tree changes (e.g. whenever React DOM modifies the page). These \"op codes\" are just an array of numbers which correspond to _operations_ like \"add something to the tree\" or \"remove something from the tree\". For example, the operation to add a component to the tree might look like this:\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n  // ...\r\n  1,   // number 1 signifies an \"add\" operation\r\n  2,   // component id\r\n  1,   // type: class component\r\n  1,   // parent id\r\n  0,   // owner id\r\n  1,   // id of component display name (corresponds to the string table)\r\n  0,   // id of key string in the string table (zero indicates no key)\r\n  // ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe format described above is highly optimized but also inflexible. (For example, if the backend needs to add an additional piece of information to the above operation, the frontend needs to also know to advance its index within the operations array by one additional place.)\r\n\r\nDevTools version 4.13 introduced the concept of a [_protocol version number_](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/21331) to allow the frontend to ask the backend which version of the protcol it used. In hindsight, **this number should have included in the operations array itself** (as the first digit).\r\n\r\n# The current problem\r\nGenerally the DevTools frontend and backend pieces are bundled together. For example, the most common DevTools surface– the browser extension– ships both pieces together and _injects_ the backend into the page during initialization. However there are some less common targets are not so tightly coupled– such as React Native (which embeds the backend into the application itself) or [Replay](https://replay.io/) (which records the backend \"operations\" array as part of its session data). In these cases, the frontend (UI) launched by the user (or embedded in the Replay player) may depend on an **incompatible protocol**.\r\n\r\nThis results in errors like #24142 and #23307 (and even https://github.com/RecordReplay/devtools/issues/5344):\r\n<img width=\"791\" alt=\"React DevTools Unsupported Bridge operation error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/160892306-2bac3e5f-7bcc-4194-8a4d-4f2eecee618d.png\">\r\n\r\n# Potential solutions\r\nAs mentioned above, **the protocol version should have included in the operations array itself** (as the first digit). We should fix this when we eventually make a major breaking change (aka DevTools version 5) but in the meanwhile, maybe there's a way we can improve the current situation.\r\n\r\nSome changes have already been made to support older protocol versions when possible (#24093) and to more clearly communicate _the reason_ for the error when that is not possible (#24147) but perhaps there's more still that we could do?\r\n\r\n## Option 1: Add protocol version to the start of the \"operations\" array\r\nWe could retroactively update the \"operations\" array to always begin with the protocol version number.\r\n\r\nWe'd need a way to _detect_ this though (to distinguish this _newer_ message format from older ones). Currently, each \"operations\" message begins with two numbers– representing the renderer and the root (tree root). For example:\r\n```js\r\n// Older message format\r\n[\r\n  3, // renderer id\r\n  1, // (tree) root element id\r\n  0, // string table size\r\n  // operations ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the current operations array starts with a positive integer (the renderer ID) it would be ambiguous to insert another positive integer (the bridge protocol version). For this reason, I propose inserting _two_ new numbers to the start of the operations array: The first one being `0` (so we can reliably detect the newer format) and the second one being the protocol version. For example:\r\n```js\r\n// Newer message format\r\n[\r\n  0, // signifies the newer operations array format\r\n  2, // bridge protocol version\r\n  3, // renderer id\r\n  1, // (tree) root element id\r\n  0, // string table size\r\n  // operations ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe frontend could then reliably distinguish between these two backend formats:\r\n```js\r\n[3,1,0,...] // old format\r\n[0,2,3,1,0,...] // new format\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Pros**:\r\n  * Would enable DevTools to get rid of the separate protocol version request method and more easily differentiate between different versions of the operations array when parsing.\r\n  * Would also enable newer DevTools frontends to parse recorded operations arrays from older backends (e.g. the Replay case).\r\n* **Cons**:\r\n  * Would require us to retroactively publish patch updates to older backend releases.\r\n  * Older frontends wouldn't support this change– and would error. (Although this is arguably no worse than the current situation.)\r\n\r\n## Option 2: Automatically fall back to support older protocols\r\nWe could leave the current architecture in place (at least until version 5) but in the case of a protocol error (`UnsupportedBridgeOperationError`) we could have DevTools try to automatically force-downgrade replay the \"operations\" array with the assumption of an older protocol version number.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially how things already work for the React Native case, (as of version [4.24.1](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-devtools/CHANGELOG.md#4241)), but formalizing it would expand to also cover usecases like Replay.\r\n* **Pros**:\r\n  * Works with pre-existing DevTools backends.\r\n* **Cons**:\r\n  * Adds code complexity.\r\n\r\n## Option 3: User configurable protocol version number\r\nWe could leave the current architecture in place (at least until version 5) but provide some sort of UI mechanism to allow users to override the default assumed protocol version number.\r\n* **Pros**:\r\n  * Works with pre-existing DevTools backends.\r\n* **Cons**:\r\n  * Poor/confusing UX.\r\n\r\n# Solutions not considered\r\nOne solution _not_ mentined above would be to add a new message type (e.g. \"new-operations\") that begins with the bridge protocol version number. Newer frontends could listen for this message, but still fall back to listening for the old message (\"operations\"). Older frontends would continue to listen to the older message and not break (at least not in any new way).\r\n\r\nThe reason I think this solution is probably not worth pursuing is that it would double the amount of information the backend sends to the frontend via e.g. `postMessage` during performance-sensitive times. One of the main goals of the new DevTools was to reduce this kind of overhead, so I don't think that's worth compromising on.\r\n\r\nA variation of this might be for backends to send the newer message type (e.g. \"new-operations\") _only_ and no longer continue to send the \"operations\" message. This would avoid the perfromance problem but would leave older frontends in a broken state (perpetually waiting on the \"operations\" array that is never sent).",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

In production we should only be sending hashes so there shouldn't be too much overhead in terms of bytes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nJest\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

If a user is on a touch device ( e.g. Safari / Brave / Chrome on iOS ) and they click the delete button, the button in the next item will now display a hover state, as if it was the button being touched.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be related to an overarching issue that's been widely documented where touch events result in \"sticky\" hover states. However in most of these cases it's a single button that is not removed after it's touched, this is expected and the default behaviour of most browsers appears to be that the hover state is maintained until a different element is touched. However in this case, the original element should be removed.\r\n\r\nReact version: 17.0.2\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open [this sandbox](https://qggwpt.csb.app/) with a touch device\r\n2. Tap the \"Delete\" button for item one\r\n3. Notice that the \"Delete\" button for item two has a red background, indicating a hover state.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/intelligent-hoover-qggwpt?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nWhen a button is touched and then removed from a list, its sibling receives the hover event.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen a button is touched and then removed from a list, there is no currently active, focussed, or hovered element.\r\n",

Obviously, this sentence does not work, and the actual \"queue\" will remain unchanged. .\r\n\r\nTo achieve the actual effect, there are two methods. The first is to use a method that can modify the value of the array itself, such as `queue.splice(0, i + 1)`. The second is to directly modify the pointer of `queue`, that is `ReactCurrentActQueue.current`, I used the second method.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change.

Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI noticed that for `ReactAct.js`, there is no corresponding test file in the `__tests__` folder, so I added one and tested indirectly through the `act` function exported by this file.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to my environment issues, the tests were not successfully executed locally. The specific reasons are still to be seen, but I decided to commit first, and then use GitHub's CI to check whether the changes took effect.\r\n\r\nIf the results are not correct, I will continue to improve my code.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a small problem, I noticed that there is an `AUTHORS` file in the root directory of the project, do I need to add this manually?",

            "body": "The approach for ids for Flight is different from Fizz/Client where there is a need for determinancy. Flight rendered elements will not be rendered on the client and as such the ids generated in a request only need to be unique. However since FLight does support refetching subtrees it is possible a client will need to patch up a part of the tree rather than replacing the entire thing so it is not safe to use a simple incrementing counter. To solve for this we allow the caller to specify a prefix. On an initial fetch it is likely this will be empty but on refetches or subtrees we expect to have a client `useId` provide the prefix since it will guaranteed be unique for that subtree and thus for the entire tree. It is also possible that we will automatically provide prefixes based on a client/Fizz useId on refetches\r\n\r\nin addition to the core change I also modified the structure of options for renderToReadableStream where `onError`, `context`, and the new `identifierPrefix` are properties of an Options object argument to avoid the clumsiness of a growing list of optional function arguments.",

If you hover on the state update, you get some information about it, such as which component caused the update, the lane the update was rendered at, and the time that the update happened. This is useful for unique components. However, for components (ex. library components) that are used in multiple places, just having the component name is less helpful. \r\n\r\nIt would be most useful to get a stack of component owners (like in the rendered by section in the Components tab). However, we only have owner metadata in DEV mode, and it usually only makes sense to profile in production. The next best thing we can do, then, is to get all the parent components and create a stack out of that (ie the return path of the fiber rather than the owner path). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1209\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2735514/160208568-771861d3-59a3-4a82-9719-c8f5663ee574.png\">\r\n\r\nWe want to add component stacks so that we also know which parent(s) caused the update. For this task, a potential solution is:\r\n* [ ] When a state update happens, walk the fiber's return path and save all the component names and their source. (See `markStateUpdateScheduled` for code pointers on where to put this)\r\n* [ ] After we're done profiling, process the stack so that we create a stack of return fibers\r\n* [ ] Pass the stack to the DevTools front end and add the component stacks to the UI when a user hovers over a state update",
